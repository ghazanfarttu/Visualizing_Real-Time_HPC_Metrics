# Visualizing_Real-Time_HPC_Metrics

### High Performance Computing (HPC)
High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of super computers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC technology focuses on developing parallel processing algorithms and systems by incorporating both administration and parallel computational techniques.

### HPC Monitoring 
HPC monitoring refers checking HPC data center in terms of HPC infrastructure health status (e.g. baseboard management controller(BMC) health, host health, CPU health, memory health, fan health) and quantitative data (system power usage, CPU temperature, fan speed (RPMs). 

### Current Progress
Currently we support current power usage however HPC real-time monitoring data is not accessible on github so unfortunately, it is not possible to have a live demo.

### Current Progress
See the output for your reference.
